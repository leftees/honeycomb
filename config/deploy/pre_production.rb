# Simple Role Syntax
# ==================
# Supports bulk-adding hosts to roles, the primary server in each group
# is considered to be the first unless any hosts have the primary
# property set.  Don't declare `role :all`, it's a meta role.

# role :web, %w{deploy@example.com}
# role :app, %w{deploy@example.com}
# role :db,  %w{deploy@example.com}

# Extended Server Syntax
# ======================
# This can be used to drop a more detailed server definition into the
# server list. The second argument is a, or duck-types, Hash and is
# used to set extended properties on the server.

# server 'example.com', user: 'deploy', roles: %w{web app}, my_property: :my_value
server "honeycombpprd-vm.library.nd.edu", user: "app", roles: %w{web app db}
